# 🗺️ Photo Intelligence Agency Roadmap

## Current Version: 0.2.0-alpha

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2024) ✅
- ✅ Initial project setup and repository structure
- ✅ Basic agent architecture setup
- ✅ Environment configuration and dependency management
- ✅ Core tool development
  - ✅ File system scanning
  - ✅ Metadata extraction
  - ✅ Embedding generation
  - ✅ Qdrant integration
- ✅ Basic workflow implementation
  - ✅ Image processing pipeline
  - ✅ Video processing pipeline
  - ✅ CUDA acceleration integration
  - ✅ Structured output organization

### Phase 2: MediaManager & Curator Integration (Current Focus) ✅
- ✅ **MediaManager Robustness**
  - ✅ File system scanning (`FileSystemScanner.py`)
  - ✅ Core processing utilities refactoring (`processing_utils.py`)
  - ✅ Environment configuration (venv313 setup and project rules)
  - ✅ Processor refinement and optimization (batch/error handling, progress reporting)
  - ✅ MediaManager workflow documentation robust and up to date
- ✅ **CuratorAgent Foundation & Integration**
  - ✅ CuratorAgent implementation and toolset (QdrantFetcherTool, ClusterTool, SummaryWriterTool, HTMLGalleryWriterTool)
  - ✅ Data structures for curated outputs (clusters, galleries) handled within tools
  - ✅ Integration between MediaManager and CuratorAgent
- ✅ **UI Proof of Concept**
  - ✅ Gradio UI implemented via `agency.run_demo(gradio=True)` for interaction and logging
  - ✅ UI is a working proof of concept for agent orchestration and workflow demonstration

### Phase 3: Large-Scale Validation & Real-World Testing (Q2 2024) ✅
- ✅ End-to-end pipeline tested with real data
- ✅ CuratorAgent and MediaManager integration validated
- ✅ UI and workflow tested with sample and large-scale datasets
- ✅ No further advanced UI or analytics planned at this stage

### Possible Future Directions (Not Planned)
- Distributed computing support
- Advanced AI capabilities (object detection, face recognition, scene understanding)
- Cloud integration, multi-user support, API ecosystem
- Further UI enhancements (customization, advanced search, filters)

## Ongoing Priorities
- Large-scale, real-world testing (e.g., 100,000+ image library)
- Robustness, error handling, and performance optimization
- Documentation maintenance and clarity
- Code quality and maintainability
- User feedback integration (as needed)

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Test the agency with a large-scale image library (100,000+ images)
2. Monitor performance, error handling, and data integrity
3. Refine based on real-world results and feedback
4. Prepare for public release only after successful large-scale validation
