# 🗺️ Photo Intelligence Agency Roadmap

## Current Version: 0.2.0-alpha

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2024) ✅
- ✅ Initial project setup and repository structure
- ✅ Basic agent architecture setup
- ✅ Environment configuration and dependency management
- ✅ Core tool development
  - ✅ File system scanning
  - ✅ Metadata extraction
  - ✅ Embedding generation
  - ✅ Qdrant integration
- ✅ Basic workflow implementation
  - ✅ Image processing pipeline
  - ✅ Video processing pipeline
  - ✅ CUDA acceleration integration
  - ✅ Structured output organization

### Phase 2: MediaManager Enhancement & Curator Foundation (Current Focus) so 
- ✅ **MediaManager Robustness (Priority)**
  - ✅ File system scanning (`FileSystemScanner.py`)
  - ✅ Core processing utilities refactoring (`processing_utils.py`)
  - ✅ Environment configuration (venv313 setup and project rules)
  - 🔄 Processor refinement and optimization
    - 🔄 Enhance error handling and recovery
    - 🔄 Improve batch processing capabilities
    - 🔄 Better progress reporting and logging
  - ✅ Update MediaManager workflow instructions *(Instructions updated: improved request recognition, robust batch/error handling, and process documentation now aligned with current toolset and roadmap)*
- 🔄 **CuratorAgent Foundation**
  - ✅ Initial CuratorAgent implementation skeleton
  - ✅ Design data structures for curated outputs (clusters, galleries) *(handled within tools)*
  - ✅ Core Curator tools implemented (QdrantFetcherTool, ClusterTool, SummaryWriterTool, HTMLGalleryWriterTool)
  - [ ] Further integration with MediaManager and UI pending
- [ ] **UI Development (Initial)**
  - [ ] Implement basic Gradio UI via `agency.run_demo(gradio=True)` for interaction and logging
- [ ] Integration between MediaManager and Curator
  - [ ] Define data flow from MediaManager's storage (Qdrant) to Curator
- [ ] Enhanced metadata organization
  - [ ] Custom metadata fields
  - [ ] Metadata validation
  - [ ] Batch updates

### Phase 3: Curator Development & UI Enhancement (Q3 2024)
- [ ] **CuratorAgent Tooling**
  - [ ] Media clustering tool (HDBSCAN, etc.)
  - [ ] Gallery generation tool (HTML templates)
  - [ ] Search and retrieval tool (Qdrant semantic search)
  - [ ] Analytics tool
- [ ] **UI Enhancements**
  - [ ] Explore more custom UI options if needed (Streamlit, Flask, etc.)
  - [ ] Gallery customization options
  - [ ] Interactive filters
  - [ ] Advanced search interface
- [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Batch processing improvements
  - [ ] Memory usage optimization
  - [ ] Processing queue management

### Phase 4: Optimization & Scale (Late Q3/Q4 2024)

- [ ] Plugin architecture

## Ongoing Priorities
- 🔄 Documentation maintenance *(MediaManager workflow instructions now robust and up to date)*
- 🔄 Code quality and testing
- 🔄 Performance monitoring
- 🔄 Security updates
- 🔄 User feedback integration

## Next Steps (Immediate Focus)
1. Enhance existing processors (`ImageProcessor`, `VideoProcessor`) with improved error handling and batch capabilities
2. Ensure consistent data format across processors for seamless Qdrant integration
3. **MediaManager workflow documentation is now robust and aligned with the current toolset and roadmap**
4. Implement basic Gradio UI in agency.py
5. Test the end-to-end media processing pipeline
6. Begin skeleton implementation of CuratorAgent
